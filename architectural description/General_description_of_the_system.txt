This is an rpg card game where, in order to win, you need to make the opponent's health become less than or equal to 0. There are many types of cards, both game and additional. During the game, you are given 6 cards each, and a deck is drawn, which is randomly generated from certain cards. During the game, your hand is filled with up to 6 cards from the deck after a turn, and the used cards are placed in the Broken Deck. What if the deck runs out, you ask? Then your Broken deck of broken cards goes into a deck that is randomly generated. That is, if your deck runs out of cards, then your broken deck is shuffled and becomes a regular deck, and the broken deck becomes empty again. That's how it is. I want to warn you that 01 and 1 are the same (00 = 0)
